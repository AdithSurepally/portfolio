# How to Edit Your Portfolio Website

Welcome to your portfolio! This guide will walk you through editing its content. All the information is stored in a single file, making it easy to update without touching any complex code.

**The only file you need to edit is `data/portfolioData.ts`**.

---

## 1. Finding the Data File

Navigate to the file located at: `data/portfolioData.ts`. Open this file in your editor to begin.

---

## 2. Editing Core Content

This section covers the main parts of your portfolio that you'll want to keep current.

### Personal Information & Profile Picture

Find the `personalInfo` section. Here you can change your name, title, email, phone, and the summary paragraphs.

```javascript
personalInfo: {
  name: 'Your Name Here',
  title: 'Your Job Title',
  email: 'your.email@example.com',
  phone: '+1 123-456-7890',
  summary: 'Your professional summary goes here...',
  profilePicUrl: '/images/your-photo.jpg', // <-- Update this path
  aboutMe: "A short paragraph about your passion and goals.",
},
```

### Hero Section Background

You can customize the background of the main hero section at the top of the homepage.

```javascript
personalInfo: {
  // ... other properties
  hero: {
    backgroundImageUrl: '/images/hero-background.jpg', // Path to your background image
    overlayColor: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.85)',     // Color and opacity of the shade
  },
},
```

-   `backgroundImageUrl`: Change this path to your desired background image.
-   `overlayColor`: This adds a semi-transparent color over the background image to ensure the text on top is readable. It uses the `rgba()` format.
    -   The first three numbers are for the color (Red, Green, Blue from 0 to 255).
    -   The last number is the opacity (from 0.0 for fully transparent to 1.0 for fully opaque).
    -   **For a light shade:** Use `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)` (white at 80% opacity).
    -   **For a dark shade:** Use `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)` (black at 50% opacity).

### Professional Experience

Find the `experience` array. You can edit your job history here. To add a new role, simply copy an existing block (from `{` to `}`), paste it, and modify the details.

```javascript
experience: [
  {
    role: 'New Role Title',
    company: 'New Company',
    period: 'Month Year – Month Year',
    description: [
      'Responsibility or achievement 1.',
      'Responsibility or achievement 2.',
    ],
  },
  // ... other roles
],
```

### Projects

The `projects` array is where you showcase your work. You can add, remove, or edit your projects here. Each project has a unique `id` that should be a simple string with no spaces (e.g., `'my-new-project'`).

```javascript
{
  id: 'unique-project-id', // A unique ID, e.g., 'bgr-layout-v2'
  title: 'Title of Your New Project',
  subtitle: 'A short subtitle (e.g., University Project)',
  category: 'Training', // Can be 'Training', 'Engineering Project', 'Internship', or 'Casual'
  date: 'YYYY-MM-DD', // Used for sorting projects by timeline
  description: 'A detailed description of what the project was about.',
  schematicImg: '/images/your-schematic.png', // Path to your schematic image
  layoutImg: '/images/your-layout.png',     // Path to your layout image
  keyLearnings: [
    'First key learning from the project.',
    'Second key learning.',
  ],
  technologies: ['Tech 1', 'Tech 2', 'Tool Used'],
},
```

### Featuring Your Best Projects

The homepage displays a "Featured Projects" section. To control which projects appear here and in what order, find the `curiosityProjectIds` array.

1.  Find the `id` of the project you want to feature from the `projects` array.
2.  Add that `id` string into the `curiosityProjectIds` array.

```javascript
// Example: To feature the 'crypto-multiplier' and 'rfid-locker' projects
curiosityProjectIds: ['crypto-multiplier', 'rfid-locker'],
```

### Education & Skills

Find the `education` and `skills` arrays. You can edit these in the same way as the Experience section—by modifying the text or copying blocks to add new entries.

## 3. Working with Files & Links

This is a critical step! To ensure your images and resume work correctly, you must understand how file paths are handled.

### The `public` Folder: The Source of Truth

**Every local file you want to use on your website MUST be placed inside the `public` folder.**

This includes:
-   Your profile picture
-   The hero background image
-   All project images (schematics, layouts)
-   Your resume PDF

### The Golden Rule for Writing Paths

When you reference a file in `portfolioData.ts`, write the path **as if the `public` folder is the root of the website**. This means:

1.  Your path **must** start with a forward slash (`/`).
2.  You **must not** include `public/` in the path string.

---

**Example 1: Your Resume**

1.  **Place the file:** `public/Adith_Surepally_Resume.pdf`
2.  **Use this path in the data file:** `resumeUrl: '/Adith_Surepally_Resume.pdf',`

**Example 2: A Project Image**

1.  **Place the file:** `public/images/my-cool-layout.png`
2.  **Use this path in the data file:** `layoutImg: '/images/my-cool-layout.png',`

---

> **⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid**
>
> -   **Incorrect Path:** `resumeUrl: 'public/Adith_Surepally_Resume.pdf'` (Includes `public/`)
> -   **Incorrect Path:** `layoutImg: 'images/my-cool-layout.png'` (Missing the starting `/`)
> -   **Incorrect File Location:** Placing files anywhere *outside* the `public` folder. They will not be found by the website. If you add a new file, you may need to restart the application to see the change.

### Social Media Links

Find the `socialLinks` section. You can add or change links to your profiles.
**Supported Icons:** `LinkedIn`, `GitHub`, `Mail`, and `WhatsApp`.

```javascript
socialLinks: [
  { name: 'LinkedIn', url: 'https://linkedin.com/in/your-profile' },
  { name: 'GitHub', url: 'https://github.com/your-username' },
  { name: 'Mail', url: 'mailto:your.email@example.com' },
  { name: 'WhatsApp', url: 'https://wa.me/yourphonenumber' },
],
```

That's it! After saving the `data/portfolioData.ts` file, your website will automatically update with the new information.
